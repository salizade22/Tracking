Introduction
=============
Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman's great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.
In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.


To run 
```
python autograder.py
```

It can be run for one particular question, such as q2, by:

```
python autograder.py -q q2
```

It can be run for one particular test by commands of the form:
```
python autograder.py -t test_cases/q2/1-bridge-grid
```
